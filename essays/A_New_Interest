The most profound question that I remember while growing up was, “What kind of career/job do you want to pursue in the future?” While growing up, I developed many interests in the artistic fields, including painting, drawing, and dancing, in which I thought that I might end up in the field of arts. Then one day, I was introduced by my friends to a dressing game and slowly became obsessed with it. I started looking up strategies online on how to pass a “level” in the game, and I remember coming across a video where I saw someone do something with lines of code. This was also my first time seeing code. But at that time I was not interested at all because I could not interpret the code.

As I grew up I realized that art was just one of my many interests and I did not have something “good enough” to show off. It no longer seemed like the right path to me, and as high school graduation was coming closer, a decision must be made. I started asking my friends around me about their choice of major in college, many chose business, and some chose engineering but none were of my interest. That was when I fell to the lowest point in my life. 

The turning point was when one of my friends started talking about their coding class. This immediately turned on my interest and I thought it would be really cool knowing how softwares programs work behind the scenes. Entering college with the choice of majoring in computer science, I had absolutely no experience in this topic, only some background research done.

I am very willing to explore new topics and learn new things. Writing my first lines of code and seeing how the program executes what I created in ICS 111 was an exciting process for me. Also, seeing how things were coming together and made sense as I studied the concepts and how algorithms work was an amazing process. In the future, I hope to improve my problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. I also need to work on communicating and connecting to other peers, such as joining a club, which I am taking into consideration.
