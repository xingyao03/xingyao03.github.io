With the experience with languages such as Java, C/C++, and python, I would say that Typescript is not that unfamiliar to me. I have noticed that many of these languages share the same or similar syntax and the way they work. Common things are like the “If-else statements” and loops such as the “for-loop.” Afterall, there are also slight differences in how a variable is declared in Typescript. I have not gotten used yet to having to declare a variable using “let” and “const” instead of “string” and “int.”

I have learned quite a few new things with respect to ES6 as it was quite challenging to go through personally. There are a few topics that I am seeing for the first time, such as using destructing assignments to extract values from objects. I thought that it was really clever that in Typescript you add type annotation to explicitly identify the type of variables, functions, and etc. Being compared to JavaScript, I would say that Typescript is like a better and “completed” version to JavaScript. It did get stressful when first being introduced to the language because I would have to care for certain syntaxes that I am not used to. 

I see the WODs as a stressful part of this class. This is because I do not like to be working under an intense environment where things are timed. I get nervous really quickly and the environment is a really big factor to how well I complete my tasks. On the other hand though, setting aside the fact that I feel uncomfortable under this situation, I think the WODs are also a good way to test how prepared I am. It is also a way to test how quickly I learn the syntax of TypeScript.
