The program is designed to support basic operations such as scan item, cancel transaction, checkout, make payment and etc. In this program, it was the first time I experimented with the main class separated from the SelfPayKiosk class. I learned a lot on the way trying to make sense of how the different classes worked on their own and puting everything together.
